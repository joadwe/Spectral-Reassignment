# Spectral-Reassignment

A script to convert the MESF values from fluorophore 1 (FL1) to fluorophore 2 (FL2). This processs requires the following knowledge:
- excitation and emission spectra of each fluorophore (many can be downloaded here: https://www.thermofisher.com/order/fluorescence-spectraviewer#!/)
- molar extinction coefficient of each fluorophore
- quantum yield of each fluorophore
- illumination wavelength of the instrument
- collection bandwidth of the instrument
